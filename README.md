## Notes
This is originally was the Summer Project of 2017.

Since then, I've realized I need to expand this quite a bit more than I originally thought.

## Backend
As of right now, I'm currently thinking about organizing it as follows:

### Server
The server is going to be built in Rails. Code will be found in this repo's /server section. It will, and SHOULD NOT be used for compilation of front end.

### Front End
For privacy's sake, the server address will be hidden in the code. It will be implemented in the actual version.
The front end is coded in React Native, which fetches from Rails' API calls.
